This is a Hello World extension for Launch. It can be used as a starting template for developing your own Launch edge extension.

For more information regarding Launch extension development, please visit our [developer documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/extension-dev/overview.html). Note the [Scaffold tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/reactor-scaffold) and [Extension Sandbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/reactor-sandbox) will be helpful in developing your own Launch edge extension.
